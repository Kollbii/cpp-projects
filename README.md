# Info about repository  
Stuff i do to learn. SFML, raylib, basic physics programs and some scripts from learning sites like cs-academy.  
  
Here is just a preview. More nice codes / simulations with descriptions can be found in */Programs*

# My take on Conway's Game of Life in raylib
The rules are on Wiki: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

### Generating random 250 x 250 size population.
White square - living square  
Grey square - dead square  

Simulation generates a random number of living squares. There is no wrapping on edges which means this simple implementation can 'stop moving' at some point.

Also if you hold LMB simulation stops and you are able to draw! :)  
Press RMB to draw with your LMB simultaneously.  (LMB -> RMB -> drawning white squares)

# Visualize sorting using SFML  
Along with @tadeuszwachowski!

Setting up array of numbers was the easiest part. But to manage this 'rainbow' flow we spent ~50 minutes and it was just as easy as 5 this lines... ðŸ¥´
```cpp
void setColors(float h, float *rgb) {
    float frequency = 0.05;
    int i = h/6.7;
    rgb[0] = sin(frequency*i + 0) * 127 + 128;
    rgb[1] = sin(frequency*i + 2) * 127 + 128;
    rgb[2] = sin(frequency*i + 4) * 127 + 128;
}
```

As said in title - program visualizes sorting. For now we implemented bubble sort and quicksort. Watch gifs!

### Quicksort visualization

Unfortunately for reasons unknown to me program crashes if it has >~180 numbers. I couldn't figure out what causes it. Maybe I'll manage later with help of @tadeuszwachowski. 

# Fractals in raylib

Simple program to draw fractals. In visualization there is 8 'trees'. Each is rotated by an angle of pi/4.  
Max range of forking angle: <Ï€;Ï€/100>

### Fractals at angle of Ï€ (a lot of lines at top of each other...)
