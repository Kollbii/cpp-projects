Stuff i do to learn. SFML, raylib, basic physics programs and some scripts from learning sites like cs-academy.

# Fractals in raylib

Simple program to draw fractals. In visualization there is 8 'trees'. Each is rotated by an angle of pi/4.
Max range of forking angle: <π; π/100>

### Fractals at angle of π (a lot of lines at top of each other...)

### Fractals at angle of ~ π/21
